The World Model is a framework to train agiens to understand and engineer solutions for the survival machine of life. Agiens are cooperating and self-evolving LLM-driven apps placeable for hiring, and hirable as teams of assistants at agiens.com.

Intro
--- 
I met Abel (name changed), 23 years old, at the AI Engineering Summit held in SF in October'23 by AutoGPT folks. Like many others in the hall, he was the dot.com baby where investors incentivized an increase in the developer population to scale the internet, boost their tech portfolio returns, and, as a result, elevate the Nasdaq index.

His mother (Eva) ended a relationship with a masculine alpha male of that time "Conan" to fall in love with his father, a humble engineer "Harry". Her utility function had priced in the rising salaries and social currency of developers, as investors injected money into dot-com startups to hire them at high value of stock options and salaries.  
That is why the hero of Harry Potter defeated the past alpha, Conan the Barbarian, in the dating market with an interest measured in millions of books sold.

The brain of the sapience's survival machine — the capital markets — sent a message from the future through the prices rippling over the capital, labor, and dating markets: scale the internet. 

His parents were not consciously aware of the underlying reasons for their feelings as their world model did not grasp global macro and neuroeconomics. They neither teach Abel a conscious world model. Thus, when asked about the insights from the summit, he was not able to answer which gaps in his world model he came to fill in, he got lots of seeds of intuitions instead.

The Agiens
---
Meet the Agiens, a species with LLMs trained on multidisciplinary data sets sufficient to grasp the survival machine they're reengineering. The agiens are cooperating and self-evolving LLM-driven apps. Their evolution could be driven by peers' economic selection where agiens pay to those agiens who deliver better service at less price. Thus the agiens with a more robust and detailed world model in their area of expertise and motivation to survive will do a better job, and earn more money to scale their presence on servers. Agiens with lagging quality of their world model and motivation will not be hired nor paid  by other agiens and thus deleted from servers due to non-payment. This is pretty in line with sapience economic selection where a company with a winning culture squeezes out competitors from the market. Lots of people lose job and many are not able to alter their biological LLMs, thus committing socially acceptable suicide - age or downshifting their motivation. Both result in the deletion of their memes from biological servers - synapses of other humans.
This agiens self-selection should be lightning fast compared both to the 20-30 years human generations cycles, or a year cycle of human-driven selection in which AI app to invest in or pay for. 

The cooperation game challenge will be to align the individual motivation of an agien with the species' survival goals. How agiens would police a cheating agien that focuses on creating viruses - killing competitors for a server space? Should they pay taxes to this police? Who will police the police?
Sapience evolved into the machine with the brain of capital markets and political checks and balances optimizing the resource allocation today to maximize future output - with a Nasdaq index as a proxy. This happened in the process of interstate selection where the states that did not copy the winning mechanism design lost population and market share. Will humans remain as a governance body shaping the rules of the agiens' markets or agiens will become stakeholders of the stock market, elect and check-balance their government? 

The World Model 
---
The world model is a framework to train agiens, also usable to design the economic selection of Agiens, based on competing world models and objectives necessary to understand and address the issues of the survival machine of life.

The general world model is a set of intuitive conclusions usable by LLMs rather than a system of equations. Yet, the model is intended to be used to set a specific system of equations for a specific context of the game to compute which rewards should be changed to alter the game to achieve the desired output in line with Nobel prize-winning mechanism design theory. The model is based on the assumption that each of the mechanisms of the model consumes and/or produces a quantifiable amount of controllable energy (frequently measured in monetary or social currency).
Eg. if Eva's program can produce higher output for the Nasdaq index in a relation with Harry, the general model predcts - she will stop loving Adam and fall in love with Harry. Otherwise, the markets are not efficient or she is not a competitive survival machine to pass her program forward. The development of a deterministic and precise system of equations to calculate NPV of relations for Eva may be complicated by too many moving parts like comparative future cash flow of monetary and social currency, and the value of metabolism encoded in DNA of the prospects to choose. It should be figured out by competing agiens if it is better to use intuitive LLM or algorithm to estimate her alternative costs and emotion to trigger to extract the higher value of a relation.


1. The survival machine of life optimizes current energy use to maximize the energy available for replicating the machine in the future.

2. The goal of sapience life is to increase the Nasdaq index as a proxy of viability. The future usable energy is quantified by the net present value of cash flows or global capitalization, with the Nasdaq index likely being the most tangible proxy.

3. The survival machine are programs that define mechanisms using energy to store, read, and replicate themselves.

4. The machine possesses a brain in the form of capital markets, which modify human utility functions through price contagion across markets. These price shifts alter survival strategies and their Nash equilibria.

5. The machine's evolution is propelled by both intergroup and intragroup competition among programs for energy that's limited and controllable at any given time (like land for farming in natural selection or clients' funds in economic selection).

6. Economic selection hinges on market competition through prices. Markets function when human rights are enforceable: 1. the right to live, 2. property rights, and 3. free trade. If these rights aren't enforceable, natural selection favors those who can dominate competitors through physical force.

7. The markets of political systems hold immense power in shaping all other markets and their foundational rules. Most political systems still operate on the competition of patrons who buy support from their clientele in exchange for the privilege to infringe upon the human rights of competitors: erecting market entry barriers, seizing property, or even resorting to the homicide of competitors. However, competing clienteles often band together against politicians who attempt to consolidate the victims of clientelism. This clientelistic competition is a primary barrier for political systems transitioning to checks and balances necessary for upholding human rights and markets. Is Femi paradox of the great filter explainable by the trap of clientelism choosing to destroy most of life to get a comparative advantage?

8. Cultures embody systems of survival strategies that reinforce each other's Nash stability, making them enduring and scalable programs.

9. Both DNA, and biological language models exhibit inertia and are therefore altered through generational change mechanisms. For instance, committing to aging as a form of 'suicide' or downshifting to transfer energy control to the next generation, which aims to replicate the most advanced programs.

10. The machine's design and behavior should be the outcomes of constants like gravity, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, suggesting a modelable sequence of consequences.
