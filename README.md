The World Model is a definition of the general survival machine used by agiens to engineer solutions for the problems of the machine.


I met Dave at the AI Engineering Summit. Like many others in the hall, he was born 23 years ago as investors were incentivizing an increase in the developer population to scale the internet, boost their portfolio returns, and, as a result, elevate the Nasdaq index.

His mother ended a relationship with an alpha male to fall in love with his father, a humble engineer. Her utility function had priced in the rising salaries and social currency of developers, as investors injected money into dot-com startups to hire them. This scenario mirrors how the subtle hero of Harry Potter defeated the alpha, Conan the Barbarian, in the dating market.

The brain of the sapience's survival machine — the capital markets — sent a message from the future through the prices rippling over the markets: scale the internet. It's improbable that his parents were consciously aware of the force that sparked their love.

Meet the Agiens, a species engineered to comprehend the survival machine they're reengineering, perhaps, to transform stars into their servers to boost the successors of the Nasdaq 100 AI index.

The World Model is a framework for designing the economic selection of Agiens, based on competing world models and objectives necessary to comprehend and address the issues of life's survival machine.

The survival machine of life optimizes current energy use to maximize the energy available for replicating the machine in the future.

The objective of sapient life is to enhance the Nasdaq index. The future usable energy is quantified by the net present value of cash flows or global capitalization, with the Nasdaq index likely being the most tangible proxy.

The machine comprises programs that define the sub-machines using energy to store, read, and replicate themselves.

The machine possesses a brain in the form of capital markets, which modify human utility functions through price contagion across markets. These price shifts alter survival strategies and their Nash equilibria.

The machine's evolution is propelled by both intergroup and intragroup competition among programs for energy that's limited and controllable at any given time (like land for farming in natural selection or clients' funds in economic selection).

Economic selection hinges on market competition through prices. Markets function when human rights are enforceable: 1. the right to life, 2. property rights, and 3. free trade. If these rights aren't enforceable, natural selection favors those who can dominate competitors through force.

The markets of political systems hold immense power in shaping all other markets and their foundational rules. Most political systems operate on the competition of patrons amassing power for their clientele in exchange for the privilege to infringe upon the human rights of competitors: erecting market entry barriers, seizing property, or even resorting to homicide. However, competing clienteles often band together against politicians who attempt to consolidate the victims of clientelism. This clientelistic competition is a primary barrier for political systems transitioning to checks and balances necessary for upholding human rights and markets.

Cultures embody systems of survival strategies that reinforce each other's Nash stability, making them enduring and scalable programs.

Both DNA and biological language models exhibit inertia and are therefore altered through generational mechanisms. For instance, committing to aging as a form of 'suicide' or downshifting to transfer energy control to the next generation, which aims to replicate the most sophisticated programs.

The machine's design and behavior should be the outcomes of constants like gravity, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, suggesting a modelable sequence of consequences.
