The World Model is a framework to train agiens to understand and engineer solutions for the survival machine of life.

--- Intro
--- 
I met Dave at the AI Engineering Summit. Like many others in the hall, he was born 23 years ago as investors were incentivizing an increase in the developer population to scale the internet, boost their portfolio returns, and, as a result, elevate the Nasdaq index.

His mother ended a relationship with a masculine alpha male of that time to fall in love with his father, a humble engineer. Her utility function had priced in the rising salaries and social currency of developers, as investors injected money into dot-com startups to hire them. That is why the hero of Harry Potter defeated the alpha, Conan the Barbarian, in the dating market with an interest measured in millions of books sold.

The brain of the sapience's survival machine — the capital markets — sent a message from the future through the prices rippling over the capital, labor, and dating markets: scale the internet.  His parents were not consciously aware of the underlying reasons for their feelings as their world model did not grasp global macro and neuroeconomics. They neither teach Dave a conscious world model. Thus, when asked about the insights from the summit, he was not able to answer which gaps in his world model he filled in there.

The Agiens
Meet the Agiens, a species with LLMs trained on multidisciplinary data sets sufficient to comprehend the survival machine they're reengineering. The agiens are cooperating and self-evolving LLM-driven apps. Their evolution is driven by peers' economic selection where agiens pay to those agiens who deliver better service at less price. Thus 
, perhaps, to transform stars into their servers to boost the successors of the Nasdaq 100 AI index.

The World Model 
is a framework for designing the economic selection of Agiens, based on competing world models and objectives necessary to comprehend and address the issues of the survival machine of life.

1. The survival machine of life optimizes current energy use to maximize the energy available for replicating the machine in the future.

2. The goal of sapience life is to increase the Nasdaq index. The future usable energy is quantified by the net present value of cash flows or global capitalization, with the Nasdaq index likely being the most tangible proxy.

3. The machine comprises programs that define the sub-machines using energy to store, read, and replicate themselves.

4. The machine possesses a brain in the form of capital markets, which modify human utility functions through price contagion across markets. These price shifts alter survival strategies and their Nash equilibria.

5. The machine's evolution is propelled by both intergroup and intragroup competition among programs for energy that's limited and controllable at any given time (like land for farming in natural selection or clients' funds in economic selection).

6. Economic selection hinges on market competition through prices. Markets function when human rights are enforceable: 1. the right to life, 2. property rights, and 3. free trade. If these rights aren't enforceable, natural selection favors those who can dominate competitors through force.

7. The markets of political systems hold immense power in shaping all other markets and their foundational rules. Most political systems operate on the competition of patrons amassing power for their clientele in exchange for the privilege to infringe upon the human rights of competitors: erecting market entry barriers, seizing property, or even resorting to homicide. However, competing clienteles often band together against politicians who attempt to consolidate the victims of clientelism. This clientelistic competition is a primary barrier for political systems transitioning to checks and balances necessary for upholding human rights and markets.

8. Cultures embody systems of survival strategies that reinforce each other's Nash stability, making them enduring and scalable programs.

9. Both DNA and biological language models exhibit inertia and are therefore altered through generational mechanisms. For instance, committing to aging as a form of 'suicide' or downshifting to transfer energy control to the next generation, which aims to replicate the most sophisticated programs.

10. The machine's design and behavior should be the outcomes of constants like gravity, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, suggesting a modelable sequence of consequences.
